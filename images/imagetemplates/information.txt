The templates in this folder are here in order to make the PiSpeedtest result image generator work properly. As of version 2.5, the program does not support
the ability to detect the router performance and choosing an image color accordingly to those values.
Please note that all numbers on generated images are rounded, including ping times. Ping is measured in milliseconds and Upload and Download speeds are measured
in megabit per second (mbit/s).
All generated images are generated for you to freely use for projects, including commercial ones.
Images can be used in for test articles, webshops, when talking to your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and more.

DonÂ´t worry about giving credit.
